This fork of the wildfly repository has modified the pom.xml file to include the Policy Enforcement Point 
{PEP} from Keycloak into the build, as describe in the Keycloak Authorization documentation under the 
"Policy Enforers" section (https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_enforcer_overview).

The PEP filters requests to resources (e.g. RESTful services, web pages) managed by the wildfly server
according to policies set by the user in Keycloak.  The wildfly server plays the role of "resource provider" in 
the UMA 2.0 world that makes up Keycloak authorization.  The wildfly server would need to be set up in Keycloak 
as a client with Client Authorization turned on.  The User (the entity managing the access policies) would need 
to set up polices to protect resources in wildfly, based on who is currently logged in.  When an administrator 
turns on Client Authorization, the Keycloak Administration Console sets up a default access rule.
